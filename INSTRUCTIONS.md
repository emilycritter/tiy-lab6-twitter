  * two feature tests

* A link to the TravisCI instance running feature tests

# Requirements

## Normal Mode
* Users can signup, and sign in
* User can follow other users
* User can see posts from [User + Friends] in their Timeline
* User can Post posts
* User can unfollow a person
* Site should look nice
* Data should be seeded (use faker)
* Get live and up and working on Heroku
* Site is setup with TravisCI.org with running Feature tests
* TravisCI deploys to Heroku, not you :)


Feature Tests:

* User can signup
* User can signin and then see timeline
* User can signin, follow a user, and then see their posts


## Difficult Mode
* User can view a profile (/jwo)
* Users can block users for being a-holes
* Users can search for posts
* Users can upload a photo of themselves
* Users can add a photo to a post


## Epic Mode
* Use test-driven-development to write tests before all production code

## Notes
* When logged in, the root URL should show the messages from all the people you follow.
* People can post "messages," "cheeps," or whatever you want to call them. They're tweets, but please don't call them that.
* Getting the list of messages for You + people you follow is tricky'ish.
